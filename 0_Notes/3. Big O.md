#### Section Overview

- Big O is one of the most important aspects to know
  - [Big O Cheat Sheet](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/big-o-cheat-sheet/)

#### 30. What's Good Code?

- Good code is Readable and Scalable
  - Readability - The code has to be clean, understandable
  - Scalabiility - That's where Big O enters in scene

#### 31. Big O and Scalability

- We are testing with performance.now() how long it takes to our code to be ran

- So when we talk about Big O and scalability, the variable is how much the inputs lengths affect the performance of the code
  - The lesser the better

#### 32. O(n)

- "What's the Big O of the findNemo function?'
  - In or case, findNemo is a linear function, in a way that each element (in the arg array) linearly increments the performance time
  - So, its called O(n)

#### 33. O(1)

`const printFirstItem = (boxes) => console.log(boxes[0])`

- This is a constant time or O(1)

#### 38. Simplifying Big O

- 4 Rules:

  1. Worst Case Scenario

  - If it's a loop, consider our element will be the last item

  2. Remove Constants

  - It's only abouy when we have something like O(2 + 3n + 100), it's simply O(n)

  3. Different terms for inputs

  4. Drop Non Dominants

  - If we calculate O(n+n^2) it's simply O(n^2)

#### 42. O(n^2) - Quadratic time

- Nested Loops (for inside a for)

#### 45. What Does This All Mean?

- Imporant to always think in the scalability of the code;

- So we always have to think in the Data Structuce and in the Algorithms we develop

- Data Sctructures + Algorithms = Programs

#### 46. O(n!)

- If the code has this notation, it's certainly wrong
  - It's a nested loop for every element

#### 47. 3 Pillars Of Programming

- WHat is good code? (Getting back to this topic)

  1. Readable (we'll dive deep later)
  2. Scalable

- WHich code is the best?
  - Readable
  - Speed (Time Complexity)
  - Memory (Space complexity)

#### 48. Space Complexity

- What causes Space complexity?
  - Variables
  - Data Structures
  - Function Call
  - Allocations

#### Summary

- Big O says which algorithm is best, considering scalaility
