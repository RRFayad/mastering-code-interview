## 5. Data Structures

#### 62. Section Overview

- Data Structures are collections of values

- Algorithms are the processes we put into place to maniputale data

- Libraries and technologies change, these are atemporal fundamentals

#### 63. What Is A Data Structure?

- Data Struture are data collections

- Each data structure has its own finality

  - Considering the trade off in time complexity and space complexity

- **How to Build** and **How to Use** data structures are the main aspect of learning it

#### 64. How computers store data

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)

  - The brain of the computer that executes instructions and processes data.
  - Responsible for running the code and performing computations.
  - Works closely with RAM to fetch, decode, and execute instructions.

- RAM (Random Access Memory)

  - Temporary storage used by the CPU to store variables, states, and intermediate data while programs are running.
  - Non-persistent: Data is lost when the computer is turned off.
  - Acts as high-speed storage compared to regular storage devices (e.g., HDD/SSD).
  - Organized into numbered "shelves" (memory addresses), each capable of holding 8 bits (1 byte) of data.

- How the CPU, RAM, and Storage Work Together

  - The CPU executes code and relies on RAM for quick access to data during execution.
  - When the CPU needs to perform a task:
  - Instructions and data are loaded from persistent storage (e.g., HDD/SSD) into RAM for faster access.
  - The CPU interacts with RAM to read and update the state while the program is running.
  - After execution, data that needs to be saved is written back to persistent storage.

- Storage
  - Persistent storage for files, applications, and operating systems (e.g., HDD, SSD).
  - Slower than RAM but retains data even when the computer is powered off.
  - Used for long-term data storage.

#### 65. Data Structures In Different Languages

- Main Data structures

  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
  - Tries
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables

- Each language has its specific data types
  - JS is mainly arrays and objects, so we have to create our own data structures

#### 66. Operations On Data Structures

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal (access exactly one data item to be processes)
- Searching
- Sorting
- Access
