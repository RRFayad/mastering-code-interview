## 4. Interview - How to Solve Coding Problems

#### 53. Section Overview

- Remember: It's not the smartest coder who gets hired, it's the first one who answers good enough the question: "Are you able tosolve the companies problems?"

#### 54. What are companies looking for?

1. Analytic Skills

- Analyze and think about solving problems;

2. Coding Skills

- Readable and Organized code;

3. Technical Skills

- Fundamentals;

4. Communication Skills

- Communication with the team

#### 55. What We Need For Coding Interviews

1. Data Structures

   - Arrays
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Linked Lists
   - Trees
   - Tries
   - Graphs
   - Hash Tables

2. Algorithms

   - Sorting
   - Dynamic Programming
   - BFS + DFS (Searching)
   - Recursion

#### 56. Exercise: Google Interview

- [Google Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)

  - Watch the Google Interview and see the applicatoin of all the steps in our [Cheat Sheet](/4.%20How%20to%20Solve%20Coding%20Problems/cheatsheet.pdf)

- Given problem:

  - You will have 2 args, an list of numbers, and a number. I want you ti find a pair of numbers in the list which adds up to the given number.
    - e.g.: [1,2,4,4], 8 should return 4,4

- My observations about the interviewee:

  1. Receives and understand the Problem
  2. Check the premises (like "Inputs will always be integers?", "Always in an array?", "Will they always be sorted?" etc)
  3. Interviewee is thinking out loud:

  - "I can loop each number, and then loop again. But it will be a quadratic notation solution"
  - "I can use binary search for pairs, but it would be a log solution"
  - "So I can scan the bigger and the smaller, whenever the sum is bigger than the number, I skip the bigger number (backwards) and if the sum is smaller than the number, I skip the smaller number. So it will be a linear solution"

- Summary:

  - Clarification of the problem
  - Before Writing code, think out loud
  - Analytical thinking through different solutions (before the code)
  - Test it in real time

### Cheat Sheet

1. Write down the key points at the top. Make sure you have the Main Goal, Inputs and Outputs.

2. What is the most important value of the problem? Time, space, memory, etc.?

3. Start with the naive/brute force approach.

   - Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e., O(n^2) or higher, not readable, etc...).

4. Review he naive approach looking for improvment - where you may be able to break things, any repetition, bottlenecks like O(N^2)

- Focus on the Big O and repeated work.

5. Before you start coding, write down the steps of the solution.

6. Modularize your code into beautiful small pieces and add comments if you need to.

7. Start writing your code now. Never start a whiteboard interview not being sure of how things are going to work out. That is a recipe for disaster.

8. If can't answer everything, all the broken steps demonstrates skill

9. Think about error checks and how you can break this code. Never make assumptions about the input.

- Comment in the code the checks that you want to do...
- Rell the interviewer that you would write tests now to make your function fail (but you won't need to actually write the tests).

10. Write code that reads well (good naming).

11. Test your code: Check for no params, 0, undefined, null, massive arrays, async code, etc...

    - Ask the interviewer if we can make assumptions about the code.

12. Finally, talk to the interviewer about where you would improve the code.

    - Are there different approaches? Testing / safe guarding?
    - Maybe ask some feedback or what was the most interesting solution you have seen to this problem.

13. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here.
    - A common question is "What if the input is huge?" The answer is usually "perform distributed processing of the data and only read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk, and combine them later".
