- It's a numbers game (we want a success rate above 1%), and one good offer is enough

- To get the interview:
    - Resume
        - Use pre made templates
        - One Page
        - Relevant Skills
            - Use Key Words the Company Use in the Job Description
        - Look Personalized
            - Changing a Headline or maybe a sentence for why I would fit well to the company
            - Include the company name
            - 1st Item on the resume should be what the company is looking for
        - What if I don't have enough experience?
            - GitHub
                - Make sure there are enough commits
                - Open Source Projects
                    - There are some open source projects in ZtM
            - WebSite (mashup template?)
